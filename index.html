          <p>The aim of the project is to detect which student is entering and leaving the college. At the end of the month based on the attendance.<br>
The object of any RFID system is to carry data in suitable transponders, generally known as tags, and to retrieve data, by machine-readable means, at a suitable time and place to satisfy particular application needs. Data within a tag may provide identification for an item in manufacture, goods in transit, a location, the identity of a vehicle, an animal or individual. By including additional data the prospect is provided for supporting applications through item specific information or instructions immediately available on reading the tag. When the student enters the classroom the card reader would be placed in front of the teacher and the student has to swipe the card and his In-Time would be marked, and when the student leaves the class his Out-Time would be marked. The students whose both In-Time and Out-Time is marked will only be considered as present. In this project we implement Automated Attendance Marking, Unit Test Result Generation, Centralized Library Automation, Automated Computer Labs, SMS Module , Report Generation. An Auto Generated mail would be sent to the principal, teachers, parents, students of school regarding the new or events, attendance, mark sheet, yearly magazine. Every student, staff, alumni would be given a username, password and they can check information related to them. For e.g. parents would be able to see the detailed report of his child attendance, mark sheet etc.</p>
